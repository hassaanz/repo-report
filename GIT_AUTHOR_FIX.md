# Git Author Configuration Fixed

The git user configuration has been corrected from 'Test User' to 'Hassaan Zaidi'.

## Issue
- Local repository had user.name set to 'Test User' and user.email to 'test@example.com'
- This overrode the global git configuration
- All commits appeared as authored by 'Test User'

## Fix
- Updated local git config: git config --local user.name 'Hassaan Zaidi'
- Updated local git config: git config --local user.email 'hassaanz@gmail.com'
- Future commits will now show correct authorship

## Note
Previous commits in the history will retain their original authorship as 'Test User' since git commit history is immutable, but this doesn't affect functionality.
